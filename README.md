## Deployment on GitHub Pages

1. Create a repository named:

   ```
   <your-username>.github.io
   ```
2. Push your project files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) to the `main` branch.
3. Go to **Repo Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → main branch, root folder**.
4. Wait a few minutes and visit:

   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io
   ```

## Customization

1. **Colors & Fonts** → Edit `style.css` for background, text colors, or fonts.
2. **Content** → Update text in `index.html` (About, Welcome, Contact info).
3. **Form Logic** → Modify `script.js` to add more fields or validations.
4. **New Pages** → Add more HTML files and link them in `index.html`.

## Testing

1. **Chrome DevTools**

   * Right-click → Inspect → Toggle Device Toolbar (📱)
   * Test responsiveness across devices

2. **Form Edge Cases**

   * Empty fields → should not allow submission
   * Invalid email → should show error
   * Valid input → should show confirmation message
